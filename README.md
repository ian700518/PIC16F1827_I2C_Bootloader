# PIC16F1827 I2C Bootloader

Bootloader adapted from https://www.microchip.com/wwwAppNotes/AppNotes.aspx?appnote=en546181 

Bootloader now compiles with Microchip XC8 compiler and is compatible with the PIC16F1827. Comments have been added where adaptions need to be made to make the code work with other devices
